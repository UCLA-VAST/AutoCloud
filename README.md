integrate performance model into a system design

sampling to charaterize the performance, after training on non-linear model, predict the performance on large dataset

finished, but need further verification:
disk I/O on specific disk devices can be profiled using constant time

experiment done:
2. code change, use small dataset to train, predict

have some intial results, To do:
1. spark version 1.6->2.1 use small dataset to train, predict
3. resource suggestion
4. shuffle stage, mapper, reducer number optimize
